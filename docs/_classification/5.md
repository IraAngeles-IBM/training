Cloud Annotations makes labeling images and training machine learning models easy.
Whether you’ve never touched a line of code in your life or you’re a TensorFlow ninja, these docs will help you build what you need.
Let’s get started!

## Sign up for [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/cloud-annotations-sign-up){:target="_blank"}
Cloud Annotations is built on top of IBM Cloud Object Storage.
Using a cloud object storage offering provides a reliable place to store training data.
It also opens up the potential for collaboration, letting a team to simultaneously annotate the dataset in real-time.

IBM Cloud offers a lite tier of object storage, which includes 25 GB of free storage.

Before you start, sign up for a free [IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/cloud-annotations-dashboard){:target="_blank"} account.


## Training data best practices
To train a computer vision model you need a lot of images.
Cloud Annotations supports uploading both photos and videos.
However, before you start snapping, there's a few limitations to consider.

* **Object Type** The model is optimized for photographs of objects in the real world. They are unlikely to work well for x-rays, hand drawings, scanned documents, receipts, etc.

* **Object Environment** The training data should be as close as possible to the data on which predictions are to be made. For example, if your use case involves blurry and low-resolution images (such as from a security camera), your training data should be composed of blurry, low-resolution images. In general, you should also consider providing multiple angles, resolutions, and backgrounds for your training images.

* **Difficulty** The model generally can't predict labels that humans can't assign. So, if a human can't be trained to assign labels by looking at the image for 1-2 seconds, the model likely can't be trained to do it either.

* **Label Count** We recommend at least 50 labels per object category for a usable model, but using 100s or 1000s would provide better results.

* **Image Dimensions** The model resizes the image to 300x300 pixels, so keep that in mind when training the model with images where one dimension is much longer than the other.

* **Object Size** The object of interests size should be at least ~5% of the image area to be detected. For example, on the resized 300x300 pixel image the object should cover ~60x60 pixels.

## Set up Cloud Annotations
To use Cloud Annotations just navigate to [cloud.annotations.ai](https://cloud.annotations.ai) and click **Continue with IBM Cloud**.

Once logged, if you don't have an object storage instance, it will prompt you to create one. Click **Get started** to be directed to IBM Cloud, where you can create a free object storage instance.

You might need to re-login to IBM Cloud to create a resource.

Choose a pricing plan and click **Create**, then **Confirm** on the following popup.

Once your object storage instance has been provisioned, navigate back to [cloud.annotations.ai](https://cloud.annotations.ai) and refresh the page. 

The files and annotations will be stored in a **bucket**, You can create one by clicking **Start a new project**.

Give the bucket a unique name.

After your bucket is created and named, it will prompt you to choose an annotation type. Choose `Classification`.

## Labeling the data
1. Create the desired labels

3. Select images then choose `Label` > `DESIRED_LABEL`
