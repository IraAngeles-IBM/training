### OSX (homebrew)
`brew install cloud-annotations/tap/cacli`

### Shell (Linux/OS X)
`curl -sSL https://cloud.annotations.ai/install.sh | sudo sh`

### Binary (Windows / Linux / macOS)
Download the appropriate version for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/cloud-annotations/training/releases). Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. You don't need to install it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don't have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.
